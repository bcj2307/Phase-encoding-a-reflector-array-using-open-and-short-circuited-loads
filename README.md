# Phase-encoding-a-reflector-array-using-open-and-short-circuited-loads
A patch antenna is designed to be able to change the load to short, open and matched load. Using the ZVA40 VNA and 2 horn  antennas, the antennas are tested for all loads. The measurements are processed in MATLAB to isolate the phase change due to  the loads and verify that it's possible to encode a phase difference on a reflector array's element.
