I would like to sincerely thank my supervisors, Dr. Stephen Paine and Dr. Gideon Wiid for the support during my research. Many thanks to the former Reutech CTO Pieter-Jan Wolfaardt for the support as well as the wonderful research topic.

I am grateful to my mother, Sunette, for the sacrifices made to allow me to complete my degree.

Thank you to everyone at Reutech, Fayruz Crombie, Shaba, Jurgens de Jager and Mike Movious for the vacation work opportunities to improve my skills and get involved in the world of radars.
